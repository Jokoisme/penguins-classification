To upload code to a GitHub repository after creating it, follow these steps:

1. Create a GitHub.com Repository
- Go to GitHub and log in.
- Click on the "+" icon in the upper right corner and select "New repository".
- Fill in the repository name, description (optional), and choose between public or private.
- Click "Create repository".

2. Initialize Local Repository
If you haven't initialized a local repository yet, do so. If you have already initialized it, skip to step 3.

#Initialize a New Repository:
- Open your terminal (Command Prompt, Git Bash, etc.).
- Navigate to your project directory:
  
  cd path/to/your/project
  
- Initialize the local directory as a Git repository:
  
  git init
  

3. Connect Local Repository to GitHub
- Add the GitHub repository as a remote:
  
  git remote add origin https://github.com/Jokoisme/penguins-classification.git
  
  Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `your-repo-name` with the name of your repository.

4. Add Files to Repository
- Add the files to the staging area:
  
  git add .
  
  This command stages all the files in the directory. You can also add specific files by replacing the dot `.` with the file names.

5. Commit the Changes
- Commit the changes with a message:
  
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  

6. Push to GitHub
- Push the changes to the GitHub repository:
  
  git push -u origin master
  
  If your default branch is not `master` (e.g., `main`), replace `master` with the name of your default branch.

Summary of Commands:
1. Initialize Git (if not already initialized):
   
   git init
   
2. Add remote repository:
   
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   
3. Add files to staging area:
   
   git add .
   
4. Commit changes:
   
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   
5. Push to GitHub:
   
   git push -u origin master
   

That's it! Your code should now be uploaded to the GitHub repository. 

For updating the exisiting repository just checkout to a branch, do git add, commit with a message, git pull and push.

Note: please make sure to switch to your desired branch.

Thanks
